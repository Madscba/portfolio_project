Getting started
============
Follow the steps in this README to run the codebase of this project.


1 Install Poetry
--------------------------
1) Install poetry (https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
   * Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
      * "curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -"
   * Update to latest version: "poetry self update"
   * (Recommended) If you prefer poetry to save your virtual environment configurations in the project folder, then run "poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true"
2) Verify that the command "poetry --version" is recognized.


* Poetry basic commands
  * "poetry install" - Initialize poetry environment from pyproject.toml.
  * "poetry shell" - The easiest way to activate the virtual environment is to create a nested shell.     
  * "exit" - To deactivate the virtual environment and exit this new shell type.
  * "deactivate" - To deactivate the virtual environment without leaving the shell use.
  * "poetry add <package_name>" - Add package to dependencies. 
  * "poetry remove <package_name>" - Remove package from dependencies. 
  * "poetry update" - Update poetry dependencies.

2 Clone repo 
----------------
1) Clone repository using SSH


3 Create virtual environment
---------------- 
1) Create virtual environment using the poetry.lock file (if .lock files does not exist then pyproject.toml will be used).
   * Navigate to project root folder in your terminal 
   * Run "poetry install"
   * Note that very few packages are installed to begin with to reduce clutter.
2) (Optional) Modify project packages to suit your needs. **Use poetry for this** and not pip
      * "poetry add <package_name>" 
        * Note that this command replaces the "pip install <>". The command install the package, and adds it to the pyproject.toml file.
      * For documentation on how to use poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/
------------------------------------------

4 Add pre-commit hooks
----------------------

We are using pre-commit to apply basic quality checks and autoformatting on the code.
   
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
 ```

On success, you should get a message like: ``pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit``.


Validate that the installation is successful with `import {OUR PACKAGE NAME}`

5 Ensure tests can run
----------------------

The repository uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the tests.

In order to check that everything works as expected, run the tests from the root of the repo by first opening the poetry shell with "poetry shell" and then "poetry run pytest".
